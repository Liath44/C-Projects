# C-Projects
Hi

This repository is used to hold C projects that were done by me during the course of my Introduction to Imperative Programming and C classes. The intent of it is to showcase my progress and capabilities in subject matters.

Few things worth noting:
1) Most if not all of the projects are done in Polish - Quite understandable considering my descent though irritating for foreign readers. It's doubtful i'll ever want to refactor it.
2) Though projects lack ToDo comment there are things that need to be done regarding some of them (adding comments, explaining purpose etc.). Sooner or later it will be done.
3) Feedback is greately appreciated: maciek_dra@wp.pl
